Final project for CSE 167 at UCSD.  OpenGL-based interactive application.  USES OpenGL, GLEW, GLFW, and GLM.  Based on starter code (mostly the shader loading and window code). All the lighting, shaders, geometry loading and rendering, scenegraph, collision, control, and particle effect code is my own.
